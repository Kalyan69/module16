Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.

Answer:
No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class. Abstract classes are designed to provide a blueprint for subclasses. They often contain one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation), which must be implemented in a subclass. Attempting to instantiate an abstract class directly will raise a TypeError.
