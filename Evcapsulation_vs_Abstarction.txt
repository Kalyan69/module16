Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation

Definition:	
	Abstraction:	Hides implementation details and shows only essential features.	
	Encapsultion:	Wraps data and methods into a single unit (class).
Purpose:
	Abstraction:	Focuses on exposing what is necessary.
	Encapsultion:	Focuses on restricting direct access to data.
Implementation:
	Abstraction:	Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
	Encapsultion:	Achieved using private/protected attributes and methods.
Example	
	Abstraction:	Using abstract methods in a class to define behavior.
    Encapsultion:	Using getters and setters to protect sensitive data.
